# Uncommon Dart Bug: Improper Exception Handling in Asynchronous Operations

This repository demonstrates an uncommon but important bug in Dart related to asynchronous operations and exception handling.  The `bug.dart` file contains code that fetches data from an API.  The `bugSolution.dart` file shows how to properly address the issue.

## Bug Description

The bug lies in the way exceptions are handled within the asynchronous `fetchData()` function. While a `try-catch` block is present, simply catching the exception isn't sufficient in asynchronous contexts. If an error occurs during the API call, the exception should be re-thrown to be handled by the calling function. This enables proper error propagation and avoids silent failures.

## Solution

The solution involves using the `rethrow` keyword within the `catch` block.  This ensures that the exception is re-thrown and can be handled appropriately at a higher level in the call stack.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.dart`. Observe the output and how exceptions are handled.
3. Compare the behavior with `bugSolution.dart` to understand the difference.

## Additional Notes

This example highlights the importance of carefully considering exception handling in asynchronous Dart code.  Ignoring or improperly handling exceptions can lead to unpredictable behavior and make debugging more difficult.
